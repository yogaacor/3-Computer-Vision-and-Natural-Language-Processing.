# 1. Enhancing Low-Light Images Using Max Pooling and CLAHE

This project focuses on improving the quality of low-light images by replicating techniques used in advanced smartphone cameras, such as Apple's Deep Fusion and Samsung's Adaptive Tetra-squared Pixel Sensor. The primary goal is to brighten dark images using Max Pooling, which combines adjacent pixels to enhance brightness. The results are then compared to the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique, another popular method for enhancing low-light images.

Objective

The objective of this project is to:

Implement the Max Pooling operation to brighten dark images, mimicking the functionality found in modern smartphone camera technologies.
Compare the effectiveness of Max Pooling with CLAHE in enhancing low-light images.
Analyze and visualize the improvements in image quality using these enhancement techniques.
